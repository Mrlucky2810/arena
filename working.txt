The Apex Arena betting platform operates with two distinct roles: Users and Admins. Users register with a unique email and password, and their initial account balance is set to ₹0. Upon logging in, users are directed to their personalized dashboard, which displays their real-time balance, transaction history, and trending games. Users can make deposits by selecting a payment method (INR or crypto), which are processed via a manual approval system by the admin to prevent fraud; funds are not added to their balance until the admin approves the deposit request. Similarly, withdrawal requests are processed by the admin, and users’ balances are deducted immediately, with refunds issued if rejected. Users can place bets on various games (e.g., Color Prediction, Dice, Crash, Mines), and their stakes are instantly deducted. If they win, their earnings (stake * multiplier/odds) are added to their balance, while losing bets result in the staked amount being forfeited. In certain scenarios like a draw, the stake is refunded. Admins access the platform via secure credentials (admin@gmail.com and admin@123), where they manage all user transactions, approve or reject deposit and withdrawal requests, and monitor user activity. Admins also have the ability to start, end, and configure games, view bet outcomes, and resolve disputes, though these features will be fully implemented in the future. The system uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring admins can manage user activity while users are restricted to their personal dashboards. All transactions and user actions are logged in Firestore for security and transparency, maintaining an immutable record for auditing purposes. This manual approval system helps ensure fraud prevention and financial integrity.
