The Apex Arena betting platform operates with two distinct roles: Users and Admins. Upon registration, users provide a unique email and password, and their initial balance is set to ₹0. Once logged in, users gain access to their personalized dashboard, which displays their real-time balance, transaction history, and trending games. However, only logged-in users can access and play games on the platform. If a non-logged-in user attempts to play a game, they will be prompted with the message: "You have to login." Non-logged-in users can still browse the website, but they cannot participate in any games. Upon successful login, users can place bets, make deposits, and request withdrawals. Deposits are processed through a manual admin approval system, and funds are added to a user's balance only after the admin confirms the payment. Similarly, withdrawal requests are processed by the admin, and users' balances are deducted immediately, with refunds issued if rejected. Users can place bets on various games (e.g., Color Prediction, Dice, Crash, Mines), with winnings instantly credited to their balance based on the multiplier/odds, and losing bets result in the forfeiture of the staked amount. In specific scenarios like a draw, the original stake is refunded. The Admin logs in using credentials stored securely in the database, not hard-coded. Admin credentials (username and password) are validated against the database, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the admin dashboard. Admins can approve or reject deposit and withdrawal requests, monitor user activity, and manage the platform’s game configurations. The admin dashboard also allows monitoring of all active bets and disputes, with the ability to issue refunds or adjust balances when necessary. The system employs Firebase Authentication for secure login, enforcing role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only admins have access to management pages, while users are restricted to their own dashboards. All actions, including transactions and game outcomes, are logged in Firestore, maintaining an immutable record for auditing and fraud prevention. This approach ensures the security and integrity of the platform by safeguarding against unauthorized access and financial discrepancies.
